        <p>Alice in Borderland and Squid Game are two dramatic dramas that are intended to make the viewer cry, and not only how to cry, but to have a crisis. Alice in Borderland is a drama about surviving deadly games. And if you're going to watch this beautiful series, get ready for the third episode.
            Just like in Squid Game, get ready for the sixth episode, because the drama takes place in Japan, and several people with very little money go into a survival game without being aware that it was survival. Seong Gi-Hun's childhood games become nightmares.</p>
