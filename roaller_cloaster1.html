        <p>Sally face and Fran Bow are 2 indies games that have been very highly rated on gaming sites, especially on Steam, as a great game.
            Both games are about serious issues about suicide and the games have a lot of blood and a lot of ''gore''. Sally face is a game more focused on the story and mainly trying to understand why Sal did a massacre in the building where he lived. While in Fran Bow it is a game focused more on puzzles and mainly on blood and the supernatural, with a very linear story in the beginning but that gets lost along the way. </p>
